<p>@nickname,</p>

<p>Thanks for volunteering to help get out the vote for the @county
    County Democratic Party.&nbsp; By becoming a Neighborhood Leader, you
    are doing the most important work in politicsâ€”talking with your
    neighbors and fellow voters.</p>

<p>The link below lets you log in to access your list of voters.&nbsp; Click
    the link and then type the username and password shown below (notice the
    dot between your first and last name).&nbsp; Please bookmark the website
    and keep your username and password handy.</p>

<p>Election Day is @electionDay, and ballots will be mailed about 18 days before,
    around @ballotDropDay.&nbsp; It is most effective if voters get the slate card
    soon after receiving their ballots, so that is when we will begin our
    canvass. </p>
